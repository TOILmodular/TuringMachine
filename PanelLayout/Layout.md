## Panel Layout for PCB
The panel dimensions provided in the section "Original Design" below are based on my own module build, since I am not following the standard HP (1HP eq. 5.08mm) size. An alternative by building an HP-standard size panel can be found in the section "HP Standard Design" further below.

### Original Design
Coordinates given in the table fit to the layout of components given in the PCBc in folder GerberFiles.
The layout is the same for both versions.

Panel size: 45mm x 128.5mm

The numbers in the table are refering to the numbers in the picture below.
Coordinates origin is the lower left corner of the panel.


| No. | X-coord. [mm] | Y-coord. [mm] |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 5 | 117 |
| 2 | 10 | 117 |
| 3 | 15 | 117 |
| 4 | 20 | 117 |
| 5 | 25 | 117 |
| 6 | 30 | 117 |
| 7 | 35 | 117 |
| 8 | 40 | 117 |
| 9 | 22.5 | 103 |
| 10 | 22.5 | 77.5 |
| 11 | 22.5 | 52 |
| 12 | 41.2 | 41 |
| 13 | 10 | 35 |
| 14 | 22.5 | 35 |
| 15 | 35 | 35 |
| 16 | 41.2 | 21 |
| 17 | 10 | 15 |
| 18 | 22.5 | 15 |
| 19 | 35 | 15 |

### HP Stadard Design
For building the panel with a size following the HP standard, you can use the panel Gerber files provided in the folder "GerberFiles".

I ordered my own panel via such gerber file built out of PCB material.

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Width | 10HP |
| Pot hole diameter | 8mm |
| Rotary switch hole diameter | 8mm |
| Jack hole diameter | 6.1mm |
| Switch hole diameter | 6.5mm |
| LED hole diameter  | 3.1mm|
| Mounting hole diameter | 3.2mm|
